# Spatial genetic simulations of HL&F in a two-dimensional plane stepping-stone model using SINS program

This directory contains the scripts and input files used for launching the [SINS](https://github.com/PopConGen/SINS) program and simulate habitat loss and fragmentation in a two-dimensional plane stepping stone model. In particular, we include:

 * [Input files for SINS simulations of HL&F](input): it includes input files for the i) instantaneous HL&F ([iHL&F](input/iHL&F)), ii) range expansion prior to instantaneous HL&F ([REx-iHL&F](input/REx-iHL&F)) and iii) two-step HL&F ([2step-HL&F](input/2step-HL&F)) scenarios.

 * [Scripts for performing SINS simulations](scripts): it includes the scripts to model the initial genetic diversity of the simulated population, scripts to run the SINS program and the scripts for processing the SINS output.
